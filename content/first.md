# Wonko's Blog

Everyone else has a blog, so I thought I'd better get one too.

Also, I needed a place to put some texts I wrote to link to when I'm trying to win online arguments.

Of course it ended up more complicated to set up and looking worse, using 500
bytes of `css`, but is now very comfortable to work with.
[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) builds the entire site from scratch in 98
milliseconds, which will help amortizing the two days I spent setting it up
because I didn't want to use other peoples themes.
You can check out the source using the link at the bottom. Feel free to submit
Issues or pull requests if I got something wrong.

## Zettelkasten

Is German for a box for slips of paper. That is how I plan on using it.
